# Memory not released after stopping an app

Use this guide when you stop an app (for example in Settings) but system memory is not freed, or when installation or restore fails because of insufficient memory.

## Symptom

- You stop an application manually in Settings, but memory usage does not drop.
- Market reports that there is not enough memory to install or restore an app.

## Cause

In Olares, some applications (for example Ollama and many LLM apps) are deployed as [shared applications](../../developer/concepts/application.md#shared-application). They provide centralized resources or services to all users in the cluster.

Resource use for these apps is mainly on the system side. In Olares OS 1.12.4 and earlier, stopping a shared app from Settings only stops its user-facing client. The system-side service is not stopped by default, so the memory it uses is not released.

## Before you begin

- The current user should have administrator privileges.
- This guide applies when your Olares system does not have sub-accounts.

## Solution: Free memory via Market

To free memory, stop apps (and their server side) from Market instead of only from Settings, then verify in Dashboard and Control Hub as needed.

### Step 1: Check current memory in Dashboard

Open Dashboard and check current memory usage.

### Step 2: Check the app's memory requirements in Market

In Market, open the app you want to install or resume and check its memory requirements. If the sum of used and required memory is greater than about 90% of total memory, installation or restore may fail.

### Step 3: Identify apps using the most memory in Dashboard

1. Back to Dashboard and navigate to the **Applications** section.
2. At the top right, use the sorting option to sort apps by memory usage.
3. Review the list to see which applications are consuming the most memory. Note apps you can close or temporarily stop to free up memory for your new app.

### Step 4: Stop apps from Market

Stopping from Market allows you to stop the shared server and release its memory.

1. Open Market and go to **My Olares**.
2. Click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">keyboard_arrow_down</i> next to the app's operation button and select **Stop**.

3. If a dialog appears when you stop the app, check **Also stops the shared server (affects all users)**.

If you are uninstalling a shared app, also check this option so the server side is fully removed.

### Step 5: Verify that memory has been released

After stopping apps, wait about 5 minutes, then reopen the Dashboard to review current memory usage.

If you notice that most memory-intensive apps are no longer listed at the top, but total memory usage remains high:

1. Open Control Hub and navigate to the **Namespaces** section.
2. Click the **Memory usage** column to sort namespaces by memory consumption.
3. Look for any namespaces with a name ending in `server-shared`. This indicates the server side of a shared app is still be running and holding onto memory.

4. For any shared app that is still holding memory:

    a. Go to **Market** > **My Olares**, resume the app, then stop it.
    
    b. In the stop dialog, check **Also stops the shared server (affects all users)** so the server is fully stopped and memory is released.
