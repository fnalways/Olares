## Reset SSH password

### Reset upon activation
Right after you activate Olares, you will be prompted to reset the SSH password on the LarePass app. The password is automatically generated and saved to your Vault.

To view the saved password in Vault:

1. Tap **Vault** in the LarePass app. When prompted, enter your local password to unlock.
2. In the top-left corner, tap **Authenticator** to open the side navigation, then tap **All vaults** to display all saved items.

### Reset in Olares Settings
If you prefer to use an SSH password instead of the automatically generated one, you can manually reset the password in Settings.

1. Open Settings. On the **My Olares** page, select **My hardware**.
2. Select **Reset SSH login password** at the bottom.

5. Click **Confirm** on LarePass to finish.
