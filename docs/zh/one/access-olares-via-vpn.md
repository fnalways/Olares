# Access Olares services securely using LarePass VPN

Typically, you access Olares services through a browser using a URL like `https://desktop.<username>.olares.com`. This way, you can reach your services from any device at any time.

While this address works from anywhere, it's recommended to enable the LarePass VPN to ensure your connection is always secure and efficient. The client automatically detects your network environment and selects the best connection method:
- **At home**: It establishes a direct **Intranet** connection to allow faster file transfers on your local network.
- **From remote**: It switches to a secure encrypted tunnel to ensure you remain connected safely when accessing remotely.

## Prerequisites
**Hardware** <br>
- Your Olares One is set up and accessible.
- A client device (computer or mobile phone) with internet access.
