# Get familiar with Desktop

The Desktop application serves as the primary interface for user interaction with the Olares system. It offers an intuitive and efficient way to manage and utilize both built-in system applications and those you install.

## Desktop concepts

### Dock & Launchpad

* **Dock:** An application quick-launch bar located on the side of the screen.
* **Launchpad:** Accessed by clicking the "Launchpad" icon on the Dock, it displays all installed applications.

### Application windows

* Applications open in "window" mode by default.
* Windows support standard operations: dragging, resizing, minimizing, maximizing, and closing.
* **Search:** Enables quick application launching, file searching, and more.

## Use the Launchpad

From the Launchpad, you can:

* View all installed applications.
* Click an application icon to open it.
* Drag icons to reorder them within the Launchpad.
* Drag an icon to the Dock for quick access.

### Uninstall applications

1. Press and hold an application icon to enter the editing mode.
2. If an "X" appears in the top-right corner of the application icon, click it to delete the application.

::: tip Note
Built-in system applications such as Files, Market, and Profile cannot be uninstalled.

### Controll application windows

You can access applications via two modes.

By default, applications open in "window" mode, which is an iframe page embedded within the desktop. You can manipulate these windows much like standard computer windows:

* Drag the title bar to move the window.
* Drag the window's edges to resize it.
* Minimize, maximize, or close the window.
* Click the <i class="material-symbols-outlined">open_in_new</i> button to open the application in a new browser tab.

::: tip Note
Some applications only support opening in a tabbed view.

## Search within Olares

You can quickly call out global search using one of the following methods:

- Press the keyboard shortcut: `Shift + Space`
- Click the <i class="material-symbols-outlined">search</i> icon in the Dock.

Global search can find applications, files, and content from supported apps.

| Search target | Supported actions |
|:--|:--|
| Installed applications  | Open the application directly. ｜
| Directories enabled for full-text search | Search and access files by filename or full-text content.|
| Other directories in File manager storage  | Search and access files by filename.  |
| Team shared files   | Search and access files shared with you by filename. |
| File manager synced drive |Search and access files by filename. |
| Wise reader content | Search and acess RSS feeds, web pages, & PDFs by name. |
| **More** |  |
| Settings  | Adjust Olares appearance. |

### Configure file search rules

By default, all files are searchable by filename only in global search.  

To improve search efficiency or enable searching file contents, go to  **Settings** > **Search** > **File Search** to configure full-text search and exclusion rules.

For details, see [Configure file search](/manual/olares/settings/search.md).
