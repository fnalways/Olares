# Curate your information hub with Wise

Wise is a local-first, AI-driven modern reader designed to turn scattered information into a personal knowledge base. As a core application within the Olares ecosystem, it serves as your central repository for managing digital content securely and efficiently.

Wise empowers you to build this hub through two main capabilities:

* **Cross-platform content aggregation**: Centralize your reading by integrating articles, videos, audio, and feeds from various sources into a single, distraction-free interface.
* **One-click bookmarking**: Save web pages directly to Olares using the LarePass browser extension, ensuring your content is always accessible and owned by you.

## Understand the interface

The Wise interface is designed to help you organize and consume content efficiently.

### Sidebar navigation

The sidebar organizes your library into three main areas:

- **Feeds**

    Your collection of subscribed sources. You can add any subscribable content here (including websites, blogs, and video channels). Clicking a specific feed allows you to toggle between **Unread** and **Read** items to track your consumption.

- **Inbox**

    Your central workspace for active content. This folder aggregates all items currently marked as **Inbox** status, regardless of their format. Items appear here from three sources:
    - Saved web pages (via LarePass browser extension or manual entry)
    - Uploaded files (PDFs, EPUBs, etc.)
    - Feed items added to your library

- **Content types** (Articles, Videos, Audios, Books, PDFs)

    Your content organized by format. Wise automatically sorts your content by its format into these folders. Within each folder, content is further divided into two tabs:
    - **Inbox**: Items of this type that you intend to read or process soon.
    - **Read Later**: Items of this type that you saved for later reading.

::: tip Customize your sidebar
You can extend the sidebar by creating and pinning **Filtered views**. These act as custom smart folders for specific tags or queries. See **[Organize your knowledge with filters](./filter)**.

### Item status

Every item in Wise has a status that can be either **Inbox** or **Read Later**. You can change an item's status using the icons in the list view or the reader view:

- **<i class="material-symbols-outlined">inbox</i> Inbox**: Indicates the item is active or "to do."
- **<i class="material-symbols-outlined">schedule</i> Read Later**: Indicates the item is archived or saved for future reading.

**When you click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">inbox</i>**: The item appears in the main **Inbox** folder and the **Inbox** tab of its specific content type (e.g., **Articles** > **Inbox**). The **Read Later** icon will be greyed out.

**When you click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">schedule</i>**: The item is removed from the main **Inbox** folder and moves to the **Read Later** tab of its specific content type (e.g., **Articles** > **Read Later**).

::: tip 
Changing an item's status instantly updates its location across all folders. You can switch between states at any time.
