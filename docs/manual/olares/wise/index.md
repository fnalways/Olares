# Curate your information hub with Wise

Wise is a local-first modern reader designed to turn scattered information into a personal information hub. As a core application within the Olares ecosystem, it serves as your central repository for managing digital content securely and efficiently.

Wise empowers you to build this hub through two main capabilities:

- **Cross-platform content aggregation**: Centralize your reading by integrating articles, videos, audio, and feeds from various sources into a single, distraction-free interface.
- **One-click bookmarking**: Save web pages directly to Olares using the LarePass browser extension, ensuring your content is always accessible and owned by you.

## Understand the interface

The Wise interface is designed to help you organize and consume content efficiently.

### Sidebar navigation

The sidebar organizes your content into the following sections:


- **Feeds:** Contains your subscribed sources, including websites, blogs, and video channels.
- **Inbox:** Your central workspace for active content. It aggregates items from all sources, including saved web pages, uploaded files like PDFs or EPUBs, and feed items added to your library.
- **Content types:** Automatically categorizes your content by format, such as **Articles**, **Videos**, and **Books**.

    Your collection of subscribed sources. You can add any subscribable content here, including websites, blogs, and video channels. Clicking a specific feed allows you to toggle between **Unread** and **Read** items to track your consumption.

- **Inbox**

    Your central workspace for active content. This folder aggregates all items currently marked as **Inbox** status, regardless of their format. Items appear here from three sources:
    - Saved web pages via LarePass browser extension or manual entry
    - Uploaded files such as PDFs, EPUBs, etc.
    - Feed items added to your library

- **Content types**

    Wise automatically categorizes your content by format (**Articles**, **Videos**, **Audios**, **Books**, **PDFs**). Each content-type folder has two tabs that reflect the item's status:
    - **Inbox**: Items of this type that you intend to read or process soon.
    - **Read Later**: Items of this type that you saved for later reading.

### Item status

Every item in Wise has a status that can be either **Inbox** or **Read Later**. You can change an item's status using the icons in the list view or the reader view:

- **<i class="material-symbols-outlined">inbox</i> Inbox**: Your primary collection for content you want to read soon.
- **<i class="material-symbols-outlined">schedule</i> Read Later**: Your backlog for content to revisit in the future.

Changing the status determines where the item appears in the sidebar, such as the top-level **Inbox** and the **Inbox** or **Read Later** tabs of its content type. The view updates instantly when you switch between them.
