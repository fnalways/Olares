# Access Olares services securely using LarePass VPN

Typically, you access Olares services through a browser using a URL like `https://desktop.<username>.olares.com`. This way, you can reach your services from any device at any time.

While this address works from anywhere, it's recommended to enable the LarePass VPN to ensure your connection is always secure and efficient. The client automatically detects your network environment and selects the best connection method:
- **At home**: It establishes a direct **Intranet** connection to allow faster file transfers on your local network.
- **From remote**: It switches to a secure encrypted tunnel to ensure you remain connected safely when accessing remotely.

## Download LarePass
To use the secure VPN connection, the LarePass client must be installed on the device you are using.
- **Mobile**: Use the LarePass app installed during the Olares ID creation process.
- **Desktop**: Download and install the LarePass desktop client.

1. Visit <AppLinkGlobal />.
2. Download the version compatible with your operating system.

## Enable LarePass VPN
Once installed, enable the VPN directly on the device you are using to access Olares.

:::tip Always enable VPN for remote access
Keep LarePass VPN enabled. It automatically prioritizes the fastest available route to ensure you always get the best speed possible without manual switching.

:::info iOS and macOS setup

## Verify the connection type
Once enabled, check the status indicator in LarePass to verify the connection type:

| Status       | Description                                              |
|:-------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Intranet** | Direct connection via your local LAN IP. Fastest speeds. |
| **P2P**      | Direct encrypted tunnel between devices. High speed.     |
| **DERP**     | Routed via a secure relay server. Used as a fallback.    |

## FAQs
### Why doesn't LarePass VPN work on my Mac anymore?
If you successfully enabled the VPN previously, but it has stopped working, you might need to reset the system extension.
:::info
Depending on your macOS version, the UI might look slightly different.
:::
1. Open **System Settings**, search for "Extension", and select **Login Items & Extensions**.
2. Scroll to the **Network Extensions** section and click the info icon (ⓘ) to view loaded extensions.
3. Find LarePass, click the three dots (...), and select **Delete Extension**.
4. Confirm the uninstallation.
5. Restart your Mac and re-enable the VPN in the LarePass desktop client.

### Why can't I enable LarePass VPN on Windows?
Third-party antivirus software might mistakenly flag the LarePass desktop client as suspicious, preventing it from launching the VPN service.

If prompted by your antivirus when opening LarePass for the first time, allow the application to continue.

If the VPN still fails to enable:
1. Open your security software and check if LarePass was blocked.
2. Add the main LarePass executable to the allowlist or exclusions of your antivirus. 
3. Restart LarePass and enable the VPN.
