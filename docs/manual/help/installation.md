# Olares installation, activation & login FAQs

This page lists the FAQs about installing, configuring, activating, and logging into Olares on your hardware.

## Installation
### What platforms does Olares support?

You can install Olares on Linux (Ubuntu or Debian) for best performance.

For product evaluation, you can also install Olares on the following platforms:
* Proxmox VE
* Raspberry Pi
* macOS
* Windows

### What is the minimum hardware requirements for installing Olares?

The requirements vary by platform. Generally:
* **CPU**: Minimum 4 cores with x86-64 architecture (Intel or AMD).
* **Memory**: At least 8 GB of available RAM.
* **Storage**: Minimum 150 GB SSD.

For detailed requirements, refer to the [installation docs](../get-started/install-olares.md).

### Can I use a mechanical hard drive to install Olares?

No. You must use an SSD. The installation will likely fail if a mechanical hard drive is used due to slower read and write speeds, which can cause timeouts during the system initialization.

### Does the system support NVIDIA GPUs?

Yes, but only **NVIDIA Turing architecture or newer** (GTX 16xx, RTX 20xx, 30xx, 40xx, 50xx series, and later). GPUs with older architectures are not recognized by Olares, and AI applications that require GPU access will not run. This requirement comes from both the NVIDIA open-source driver, which requires Turing's hardware GSP module, and CUDA 13.x, which no longer supports older GPU architectures.

For supported GPUs, Olares automatically handles driver installation. It also supports multiple GPUs on a single motherboard, allowing users to leverage all available compute power for AI workloads.

### How do I manually install NVIDIA drivers if the automatic setup fails?

The Olares installer usually detects and installs drivers automatically. However, if your system previously had NVIDIA drivers installed, the process might be skipped or fail due to conflicts.

In this case, you should:
1. Reboot the machine after the Olares installation to ensure any old driver components are fully cleared.
2. Manually trigger the driver installation using the command `olares-cli gpu install`.

After installation, you can confirm that the drivers are installed and your GPU is recognized by running `nvidia-smi`.

### Why does installation fail with `failed to build Kubernetes objects` or `Ensure CRDs are installed first`?

While these error messages suggest a problem with Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), they are often a symptom of poor disk performance.

Olares relies on etcd, the backing database for Kubernetes. etcd is very sensitive to storage speed. If you are installing Olares on a slow disk, such as a traditional HDD, etcd cannot respond fast enough. This causes the API server to time out while attempting to apply CRDs.

Installing Olares on SSD storage should fix this issue.

### My Olares installation timed out and didn't show a password, but the system seems to be running. How can I find the password?
This typically occurs when the installation times out due to insufficient system resources, especially in a virtual machine (VM). You can retrieve the password from the installation log file with the following command:
```bash
# Replace v1.12.2 with your specific Olares version number.
grep password $HOME/.olares/versions/v1.12.2/logs/install.log
```
An installation timeout often means some services failed to start correctly. After finding your password, run  `kubectl get pod -A` to check the status of all services.

## Activation
### Is it possible to activate Olares with a non-local network?

Yes. Before activation, users typically access the activation wizard using the local IP address, which generally requires both parties to be on the same network. However, if Olares is assigned a public IP, such as on a public cloud, this local network limitation no longer applies.

Note that IP access is only used during activation. Once activated, devices can be accessed via domain names on both internal and external networks.

### My Olares is powered on and connected to LAN, but I can't find it in LarePass. What should I do?

Ensure both your phone and Olares device are on the same network. If they are not, LarePass cannot discover Olares automatically.

In situations where you cannot connect via Wi-Fi, you can use the Bluetooth network setup in the LarePass app to connect Olares to the same network as your phone.

For details, see [Activate Olares using Bluetooth](../../manual/larepass/activate-olares.md#activate-olares-using-bluetooth).

### I received the MFA binding error. How can I resolve it?

The request to bind Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) failed due to a network timeout. Check your network connection and retry the setup process.

### I received a DID binding error. How to resolve it?

The request to the binding-zone interface failed due to a network timeout. This usually happens during account activation. Ensure your network is stable and retry.

### What does this error message mean: "Invalid jws, timestamp is out of range"?

This occurs when there is a significant time difference (greater than 20 minutes) between the device running LarePass and the Olares device. Check the system time on your computer or phone and ensure it is synced correctly with internet time.

### I see this error message during setup: "Resolve name error". How to fix it?

This error means your Olares device cannot connect to the Olares identity service, which is usually caused by the network issue. Check your internet connection and ensure your Olares device has proper network access.

## Login and authentication

### What should I do when I see "Authentication failed, incorrect password"?

This indicates the password entered is not accurate. Double-check your password for issues like typos or case sensitivity and try again.

### What does this mean: "Authentication failed, user not found"?

The system cannot find an account associated with the username entered. Verify that the username is correct and this username is already registered on Olares.

### I received an error saying "Authentication failed, failed to query user from lldap service". How to resolve it?

The system was unable to retrieve user details from the internal directory. This might happen if the user data is corrupted or if the service is momentarily busy. Try again or contact your administrator.

### I am locked out with the message "too many failed login attempts, retry again later after 5 minutes". What should I do?

For security reasons, the system temporarily locks logins after multiple incorrect attempts. Wait for 5 minutes and then try logging in again.

### Why am I getting "Authentication failed, disk space is full"?

Your Olares device storage is completely full, which prevents the authentication service from running correctly. Free up disk space on the device to resolve this issue.

### What does this error message mean: "Authentication failed, lldap service is unavailable"?

The internal identity service "LLDAP" on your Olares device is not running or is experiencing issues. Restart the Olares device and try again, or contact your administrator.

### What does this error message mean: "Authentication failed, citus service is unavailable"?

The internal database service "Citus" is currently unavailable. This is usually a temporary system issue. Restart your Olares device.
