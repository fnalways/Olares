# Expand storage via USB devices <Badge type="tip" text="5 min" />

Olares One automatically detects and mounts inserted USB storage devices, allowing you to instantly expand your storage capacity for media, backups, or file transfers.

## Prerequisites
**Hardware**
- A compatible USB flash drive.
  :::warning Compatibility
  Olares One is tested with Samsung and SanDisk USB drives. Other brands might not be recognized by the system.
  :::
## Connect and access storage

1. Insert your USB flash drive into an available USB port on Olares One. It will be mounted automatically. 
2. Open the Files app and select **External** in the sidebar to access your files.

## Safely remove the device

Although the system automatically unmounts the device when you physically unplug it, removing a drive while data is being written can cause file corruption.

It is recommended to manually eject the device first:
1. Open the Files app. 
2. Right-click the USB drive in the sidebar and select **Unmount**. 
3. Once the drive disappears from the list, you can safely unplug it.
