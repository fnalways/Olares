# Download YouTube videos in Wise <Badge text="15 min"/>

Wise lets you save YouTube videos directly into your library for offline viewing. Unlike a standard file download, saving to the library ensures the video appears within the Wise application, allowing you to manage, play, and organize it alongside your other content.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Save a YouTube video to your Wise library by pasting a link in Wise (recommended).
- Save a video from your browser using the LarePass extension.
- Check download progress and watch the video offline.

## Install Wise and YT-DLP

Before downloading YouTube videos, make sure the following apps are installed from Olares Market:
- **Wise**: The interface.
- **YT-DLP**: The background downloader service.

1. Open Market from your Launchpad.
2. Search for "Wise", click **Get**, then **Install**.
3. Search for "YT-DLP", click **Get**, then **Install**.

## Save video to library

You can save videos by pasting the URL directly in Wise or by using the LarePass extension while browsing.

### Paste URL in Wise <Badge text="recommended"/>

1. Copy the URL of the YouTube video.
2. Open Wise, click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">add_circle</i> in the bottom-left menu bar, then select **Add link**.
3. Paste the URL into the input field. Wise analyzes the link immediately.
4. In the panel, locate the Save to library section:
    - **Video is ready**: Click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">box_add</i> next to the video item to save it.

    - **Login is required**: If you see a prompt to log in to the site and upload cookies, simply click **Upload**. Once the status updates, click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">box_add</i> to save.
    
### Use LarePass extension

If you frequently save videos while browsing, the [LarePass extension](https://www.olares.com/larepass) can be more convenient, but it requires installing the extension first.

1. Open the YouTube video in your browser.
2. Click the LarePass browser extension icon in your browser toolbar and select the "Collect" icon.
3. In the panel, locate the Save to library section:
   - **Video is ready**: Click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">box_add</i> next to the video item to save it.
    ![Save video via larepass](/images/one/wise-save-to-lib-larepass.png#bordered){width=60%}
   
   - **Login is required**: If you see a prompt to log in to the site and upload cookies, simply click **Upload**. Once the status updates, click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">box_add</i> to save.

## Monitor and manage video downloads

When you save a video to the library, Wise creates a record immediately, and the file download runs in the background.

1. In Wise, click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">settings</i> in the bottom-left menu bar, then select **Transmission**.
2. In the Download tab, check the list of downloads and their status.
3. You can:

    - Click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">folder_open</i> to locate a downloaded file in Files.
    - Click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">do_not_disturb_on</i> to remove it from the list.

Once the download is complete, you can play the video directly inside Wise even without an internet connection.
