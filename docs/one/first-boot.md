### Use custom domains

By default, your Olares ID uses the olares.com domain. This means you access your Olares services through URLs like desktop.{your-username}.olares.com without complex network configurations.

When you are familiar with the system, you might want to use a custom domain such as employee@company.com or me@my-personal-domain.com for a personalized experience. For more information, see [Set up a custom domain for your Olares](../manual/best-practices/set-custom-domain.md).
