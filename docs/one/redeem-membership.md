# Redeem Olares Space membership <Badge type="tip" text="Kickstarter Backers Only" />

If you backed Olares One on Kickstarter, your package includes an "Olares Space Membership" card. This card grants you a complimentary 2-year Basic membership to use the enhanced connectivity services provided by Olares Space.

:::tip Olares One is a one-time purchase
Your Olares One hardware and system updates are free forever.

Olares Space is completely optional, so you are never locked in. If you choose not to renew your membership after the complimentary period ends, your use of Olares One will not be affected in any way.
:::

## Before you begin

Olares Space is a secure connectivity platform that extends the capabilities of your local device without compromising data sovereignty. The Basic plan includes:
* **Cloud backup**: Up to 50 GB of integrated cloud storage for critical data redundancy. The free alternative is to back up your data to a local external drive or your own S3-compatible storage provider.
* **Remote access (FRP)**: High-speed remote connection with 50 GB of monthly traffic at speeds up to 50 Mbps. This includes access to regional acceleration nodes for faster response times. If you exceed the monthly quota, speed is throttled to 5 Mbps. The free alternative is to use the LarePass VPN or host your own FRP server.
