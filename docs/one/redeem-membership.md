<Badge type="tip" text="15 min" /> <Badge type="tip" text="Kickstarter Backers Only" />

Follow the steps on this page to redeem your membership.

## Learning objectives

- Understand the features of Olares Space.
- Activate your Basic membership.
- Manage or transfer your membership between accounts.

## Before you begin

Understand what Olares Space is and how your specific membership works.

### What is Olares Space

Olares Space is a fully managed cloud platform that extends the capabilities of your local device. It provides essential infrastructure services, including secure remote access, automatic data backups, and custom domain management.

### Plans and features

Olares Space offers two subscription tiers:
- **Free**: It provides standard speed and connectivity, with backups managed by the user via local devices or third-party cloud services.
- **Basic**: It provides faster speeds, lower latency through regional nodes, higher data limits, and integrated cloud storage for backups.

|Feature|Free|Basic|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Monthly data quota|Up to 2 GB|Up to 50 GB|
|Connection speed within quota|Up to 5 Mbps|Up to 50 Mbps|
|Connection speed exceeding quota|Throttled to 1 Mbps|Throttled to 5 Mbps|
|Network performance|Standard nodes|Regional nodes (faster response)|
|Backup storage|Local or 3rd-party only|50 GB Olares Space storage|
|Support|Community support, docs|Priority email support|

### Your complimentary membership

The complimentary card provides the Basic plan to you for two years.
- Benefits: Faster remote connection speed, higher bandwidth limit, and priority support compared to the Free plan.
- The "Key": Your membership is tied to the email address used for your Kickstarter order, not the physical card.
- Activation: The 2-year validity period begins the moment you successfully bind this email to an Olares ID.

### Change bound email

If you replace your Kickstarter email with a different email in the account email settings:

- Your current account will lose the Basic membership immediately, and the plan will change to Free.
- To re-gain the Basic plan, use one of the following methods:
    - Re-bind the original Kickstarter email. This restores your complimentary Basic membership, but reduces the remaining validity period by one month.
    - Purchase a Basic subscription.
