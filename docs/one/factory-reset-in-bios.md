# Reset to factory settings in BIOS <Badge type="tip" text="10 min" />

Resetting to factory settings returns your Olares One to its initial setup state. If you have a monitor and keyboard connected, you can perform this reset directly in BIOS instead of using LarePass.

:::warning Data loss
This will permanently delete all accounts, settings, and data on the device. This action cannot be undone.
