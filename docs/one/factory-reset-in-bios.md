# Reset to factory settings in BIOS <Badge type="tip" text="10 min" />

Resetting to factory settings returns your Olares One to the initial setup state. If you have a monitor and keyboard connected, you can perform this reset in BIOS instead of using LarePass.

This will permanently delete all accounts, settings, and data on the device. This action cannot be undone.

## Prerequisites

- A wired keyboard connected to Olares One.
- A monitor connected to Olares One.

## Reset Olares One to factory settings

1. Power on Olares One or restart if it is already running.
2. Immediately press the **Delete** key repeatedly until the BIOS setup screen appears.
3. Press **F9**, then select **Yes** to restore factory settings.
4. Press **F10**, then select **Yes** to save and exit. The device will restart automatically.
