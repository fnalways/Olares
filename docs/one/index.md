## What is Olares One?
Olares One is a dedicated hardware device designed to run a personal AI cloud. It combines workstation-grade hardware with Olares OS to provide a platform for running AI tools and managing data locally.

Modern digital life often trades privacy for convenience by sending personal data and AI prompts to centralized servers. Olares One replaces this model with hardware you physically control, which allows for local data processing for AI agents and file storage.

Primary use cases include:
* **Edge AI**: Run open-source AI models for text or media generation directly on the hardware with complete data privacy.
* **Gaming**: Turn the device into a gaming server with the Steam Headless app to play titles on Olares One, or on any compatible devices.
* **Personal knowledge base**: Allow AI models to learn from private documents to function as a personal assistant.
* **Unified file storage**: Use the Files app to manage, sync, and share files.
* **Self-hosted workspace**: Run a private suite of productivity and collaboration tools on the local device.
* **App development**: Use Olares Studio to develop and deploy applications for the Olares environment.
* **Private media server**: Host and stream movie and music collections using apps like Jellyfin.

## What is Olares OS?
Olares is an open-source personal cloud operating system based on Kubernetes designed to empower users to own and manage their digital assets locally.

While Olares One includes the software by default, Olares OS is also available for installation on other hardware. For details, see [Install Olares](../manual/get-started/install-olares.md).
