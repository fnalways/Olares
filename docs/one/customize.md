:::tip Keep it simple
A clear name plus a one-line description is usually enough to make a good first impression.

### Add social links

Use the **Social** tab to display icons under your header. This connects visitors to your presence on other platforms such as X, GitHub, or LinkedIn.

You can add links for multiple platforms and choose which ones to display. To hide a link temporarily, toggle it off without deleting the saved value.

### Build with blocks

Use the **Blocks** tab to construct the main body of your page. Click **+ Add Block** and select a type to enter the editing screen.

Each block type helps you share different content:
- **Text:** Add a title or paragraph. You can adjust text alignment and background transparency.
- **Link:** Enter a website URL or email address. You can customize the button title, subtitle, and shadow style.
- **Image:** Upload a photo. You can add a description and choose the aspect ratio that fits your image best.

Once you have added your blocks, you can manage the layout directly in the list:
- Drag items to reorder them.
- Toggle a block off to hide it temporarily.
- Copy a block to reuse its style.

### Configure appearance

Use the **Appearance** tab to define the visual style. You can select a preset theme, and manually fine-tune the fonts and block shapes to match your style.
