## Automate multi-step workflows

The Pipeline feature functions like a batch processing workflow for PDFs.
Instead of performing tasks one by one, you can create a custom pipeline to execute multiple actions in a single sequence. This scenario demonstrates the feature by merging documents and adding a password.

:::info
The Pipeline feature is currently in Beta. You might encounter occasional instability or interface changes. It is recommended to verify the final output when processing critical documents.
