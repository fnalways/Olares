## Pair Sunshine with Moonlight

Steam Headless integrates Sunshine, an open-source streaming server. To stream games, you must pair it with your Moonlight client.

### Access the Sunshine console

Access the Sunshine console to pair your Moonlight client with Olares.

1. From your Steam Headless browser tab, copy its URL.
2. In your browser, enter the address to access Sunshine. The address varies depending on your network.
   - **Same network**: Replace the protocol `https` with `http`, change the domain suffix to `.local`, and append `:47990`. For example:
    
   ```
   http://139ebc4f0.<your Olares ID>.olares.local:47990
   ```

   - **Different network (via VPN)**: [Enable LarePass VPN](../manual/larepass/private-network.md#enable-vpn-on-larepass) on your device, then append `:47990`. For example: 
   
   ```
   https://139ebc4f0.<your Olares ID>.olares.com:47990
   ```

3. Press **Enter** to open the Sunshine console page. 
4. Sign in using the `SUNSHINE_USER` and `SUNSHINE_PASS` credentials you created earlier.

5. Click the **PIN** tab. The page will now wait for a pairing PIN.

### Add the host in Moonlight

Moonlight usually detects your Olares host automatically when it is on the same local network as your Olares device.

If it doesn't appear, or if you are connecting over different networks, follow these steps to add the host manually. The process shown below uses the macOS Moonlight client.

:::info Connecting from a different network? 
If your Moonlight client and Olares device are on different networks, you must first [enable LarePass VPN](../manual/larepass/private-network.md#enable-vpn-on-larepass) on the device running Moonlight. 
:::

1. Open Moonlight on your streaming device.
2. Click the **Add Host** button (looks like a computer with a plus icon).
3. Enter your Olares domain without the `https://` prefix. For example: 

   ```
   139ebc4f0.<your Olares ID>.olares.com
   ```
4. Click **OK**. A new locked host icon appears.
5. Click the locked icon. Moonlight will display a 4-digit pairing PIN.

### Complete pairing

1. Return to the **Sunshine PIN** page in your browser.
2. Enter the PIN displayed in Moonlight and give your device a name.
   ![Enter pairing PIN](../public/images/manual/use-cases/steam-enter-pairing-pin.png#bordered)
3. Click **Send**. When pairing succeeds, you'll see:
   ```text
   Success! Please check Moonlight to continue
   ```
   ![Pairing succeeds](../public/images/manual/use-cases/steam-pairing-succeeds.png#bordered)
4. Back in Moonlight, your host icon should now appear unlocked and active.

Once paired, you're ready to start streaming.

## Stream your games

You can stream your games through Moonlight either locally or remotely, depending on your network setup.

The following steps demonstrate local streaming.

1. Open **Moonlight** on your client device.
2. Select your unlocked host and click the **Steam** icon.  
   ![Steam in Moonlight](../public/images/manual/use-cases/steam-in-moonlight.png#bordered)

Steam now enters Big Picture mode and you can start playing your games.

:::tip Remote streaming
To play from outside your home network, [enable **LarePass VPN**](../manual/larepass/private-network.md#enable-vpn-on-larepass) before opening Moonlight.  
Once connected, follow the same steps above to stream your games remotely.

## FAQs

### Why isn't the game displaying in full screen?

This may be caused by resolution settings. Try adjusting the resolution:

- **In Moonlight**: Go to **Settings** > **Basic Settings** > **Resolution and FPS**.
![Display in Moonlight](../public/images/manual/use-cases/steam-display-in-moonlight.png#bordered)
- **On the Steam console page**: Go to **Applications** > **Settings** > **Display**.  
![Display in Steam Headless](../public/images/manual/use-cases/steam-display-in-steam-hd.png#bordered)

### How do I exit full-screen streaming?

Use the following shortcuts:
- **Windows**: `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Q`  
- **Mac**: `Control (^) + Option (⌥) + Shift + Q` 
- **Mobile**: `Start + Select + L1 + R1`

   ![Exit Steam Big Picture Mode](../public/images/manual/use-cases/steam-exit-big-pic.png#bordered)

### Where are my downloaded games stored?

You can check the downloaded games in the Files app. By default, games are saved in: 

```
/Cache/olares/steam-headless/c0/.steam/steam/steamapps/common
```

We recommend not changing this default directory.

### Why do I get an error when re-pairing the host in Moonlight?

If you delete your Olares host in Moonlight and try to pair again, you may encounter the following errors:

- **The PIN from the PC didn't match. Please try again.**
- **Request timed out (Error 4)**
- **Connection closed (Error 2)**

This usually happens when the Sunshine service is not responding.
To fix it, simply restart Steam Headless in Olares and try pairing again:

1. Open Control Hub from Launchpad.
2. Navigate to **Browser** > **steamheadless** > **Deployments** > **steamheadless** > **Restart**. 
   ![Restart Steam Headless](../public/images/manual/use-cases/steam-restart.png#bordered)
3. In the confirmation prompt, enter `steamheadless` and click **Confirm**.
   ![Confirm restart](../public/images/manual/use-cases/steam-confirm-restart.png#bordered)
4. Once restarted, pair with Sunshine again in Moonlight.

### How do I change my Sunshine username or password?

You can change your Sunshine credentials directly from the Sunshine web console.

1. Open Sunshine in your browser using your local address, for example: `http://139ebc4f0.<your Olares ID>.olares.local:47990`. 
2. Log in with your current username and password.
3. Go to the **Change Password** tab.
